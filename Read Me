Idea 1 - Popular Video Games recommendation system using Machine Learning
Problem Statement: The video game industry is constantly expanding, making it overwhelming for users to find games that align with their interests. While platforms offer recommendations, they often rely on simple metrics like sales or user ratings, overlooking individual preferences and the nuanced factors that contribute to enjoyment. This can lead to frustration for users. I want to develop a machine learning model that provides personalized video game recommendations to improve user satisfaction and game discovery.
Data needed:
Video Games Database from Kaggle
